                            <p>Barack Obama, the former President turned visionary, stumbled upon a game-changing 
                            method while casually strolling along the serene shores of Hawaii. Picture him, 
                            captivated by the dance of sunlight on the translucent grains of sand, 
                            when suddenly, a spark of inspiration ignites. In a burst of curiosity, 
                            he embarks on a journey of experimentation and collaboration with top researchers, 
                            delving into the intricate world of glass transformation. Through twists and turns
                            and flashes of insight, he unveils a groundbreaking technique: the ability to dissolve glass into sand.</p></details>

                            <p>Kanye West and Casper the Friendly Ghost find themselves in a predicament of cosmic proportions: stranded at the bottom of a well in Northern Peru. How they got there remains a mystery, but their absence from the meeting is undeniable. As they exchange bewildered glances in the dim light of the well, Kanye's trademark confidence clashes amusingly with Casper's ever-cheerful demeanor. Despite their otherworldly circumstances, they bond over shared frustration and a touch of humor, wondering how on earth they'll explain this one to their colleagues. Alas, until they figure out a way to escape their unexpected underground abode, the meeting will have to proceed without them.                    </p></details>

                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Good morning, everyone. Let's dive into our agenda. Sally, what's the deal with your computer?</li>
                         <li><i>Sally</i>: <i>Beep</i> Every time I press "y," my computer starts a new line. It's driving me crazy.</li>
                        <li><i>Donna Strickland</i>: That's peculiar. Have you tried restarting your system, Sally?</li>
                        <li><i>Sally</i>: <i>Beep</i> Beep beep Oh, I've tried everything! I even took it to the mechanic, but they couldn't figure it out either.</li>
                        <li><i>Tim Horton</i>: Sounds like a real head-scratcher. Have you noticed any other issues besides the "y" key?</li>
                        <li><i>Sally</i>: <i>Beep</i> Not really. Everything else seems to be working just fine. It's just this pesky "y" that's causing trouble.</li>
                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Hmm, it could be a software glitch. Tim, could you take a closer look at it after the meeting?</li>
                        <li><i>Tim Horton</i>: Absolutely, Mr. President. I'll bring my toolkit and see what I can do.</li>
                        <li><i>Sally</i>: <i>Beep</i> Thank you, Tim. I really appreciate it.</li>
                        <li><i>Sachin Tendulkar</i>: You know, I once had a similar problem with my cricket bat. Every time I swung it, it made a strange noise.</li>
                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Well, let's hope Tim can fix Sally's computer quicker than you fixed your bat, Sachin.</li>

                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Now, onto Tom's brilliant idea to solve world hunger. Tom, care to explain?</li>
                        <li><i>Tom</i>: Meow, thank you, Mr. President. We'll use cheese to feed the world!</li>
                        <li><i>Hillary Clinton</i>: Cheese, Tom? Really?</li>
                        <li><i>Tom</i>: Hey, it's worth a shot!</li>
                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Alright, let's entertain this for a moment. Tom, how do you propose we implement this cheesy solution on a global scale</li>
                        <li><i>Tom</i>: Well, we start by setting up cheese factories in every corner of the world. Then, we distribute the cheese to those in need, one slice at a time.</li>
                        <li><i>Ye Wenjie</i>: But what about the lactose intolerant?</li>
                        <li><i>Tom</i>: Uh, well, we could also offer dairy-free alternatives... like soy cheese?</li>
                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Alright, let's get back on track. Tom, how do you envision using this solution to gain power?</li>
                        <li><i>Tom</i>: Meow, well, by controlling the world's cheese supply, we'll have leverage over every nation. They'll have to bow to our dairy dominance!</li>
                        <li><i>Ye Wenjie</i>: It sounds like a plan straight out of a cheesy movie.</li>
                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Alright, let's explore more practical ways to address world hunger and gain influence on the global stage.</li>

                        <li><i>Ariana Grande</i>: Well, I think we should bring more flair and excitement to our branding. Maybe add some sparkle, a little pizzazz</li>
                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: That's a great idea, Ariana. We want our initiatives to stand out and capture people's attention.</li>
                        <li><i>Ariana Grande</i>: Oh, you know me, Mr. President. I'm all about standing out and capturing attention.</li>
                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Alright, let's brainstorm ways to infuse our branding with more personality and energy and have them ready by next meeting.</li>

                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Alright, let's focus on our strategy for capturing Greenland. Any ideas?</li>
                        <li><i>Pradeep Kohsla</i>: Well, we could offer them economic incentives and infrastructure development projects to sway their allegiance. Or, we could just buy them out with our fat wallets, if you catch my drift.</li>
                        <li><i>Hillary Clinton</i>: Or we could take a more aggressive approach. We have the military might to simply seize control if negotiations fail.</li>
                        <li><i>Pradeep Kohsla</i>: Yeah, because who needs diplomacy when you've got tanks, am I right?</li>
                        <li><i>Barack Obama</i>: Let's keep our options open, Pradeep. We need to approach this situation with caution.</li>
                        <li><i>Ariana Grande</i>: How about we dazzle them with a star-studded concert? I could headline, of course, and we could throw in some other A-listers to sweeten the deal.</li>
                        <li><i>Ye Wenjie</i>: Or we could unleash a cyber attack, crippling their infrastructure and forcing them into submission.</li>
                        <li><i>Kabir Vats</i>: Let's go with that.</li>
